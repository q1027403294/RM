        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis via artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning and large language models (LLMs), is a pivotal tool that classifies sentiments within texts as positive, negative, or neutral. It enables computers to automatically detect and interpret emotions from textual data, covering a spectrum of feelings without direct human intervention. Sentiment analysis is integral to marketing research, helping to gauge consumer emotions and opinions across various sectors. Its applications span analyzing movie reviews, monitoring social media, evaluating product feedback, assessing employee sentiments, and identifying hate speech. This study explores the application of both traditional machine learning and pre-trained LLMs for automated sentiment analysis of customer product reviews. The motivation behind this work lies in the demand for more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments that can drive data-informed business decisions. In this research, we applied machine learning-based classifiers, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, alongside the GPT-4 model to benchmark their effectiveness for sentiment analysis. Traditional models show better results and efficiency in processing short, concise text, with SVM in classifying sentiment of short length comments. However, GPT-4 showed better results with more detailed texts, capturing subtle sentiments with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores to uniquely identify mixed sentiments not found in the simpler models. Conclusively, this study shows that LLMs outperform traditional models in context-rich sentiment analysis by not only providing accurate sentiment classification but also insightful explanations. These results enable LLMs to provide a superior tool for customer-centric businesses, which helps actionable insights to be derived from any textual data.",

        "abstract": "Consumer sentiment analysis is a recent fad for social media-related applications such as healthcare, crime, finance, travel, and in academia. Disentangling consumer perception to gain insight into the desired objective and reviews is significant. With the advancement of technology, a massive amount of social web data increasing in volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity becomes challenging to process manually. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized to handle this difficulty in real-life applications. This paper presents a study to determine the usefulness, scope, and applicability of this alliance of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis (CSA) for online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. We show a systematic literature review to compare, analyse, explore, and understand the attempts and directions to find research gaps in illustrating the future scope of this pairing. The primary objective is to read and analyse the use of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. This research has significant implications for service providers in terms of developing managerial strategies for consumers in terms of selecting services that meet their needs. Furthermore, there is high impact for researchers in terms of prospective research directions.",

This is a crucial step to sentiment analysis, considering prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing text. Beginning with an approach that used speech-based features, automatic sarcasm detection has witnessed great interest from the sentiment analysis community. This article is a compilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe three milestones in the research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and incorporation of context beyond target text. In this article, we describe datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, describe shared tasks, and provide pointers to future work, as given in prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state-of-the-art, the survey presents several useful illustrations\u2014most prominently, a table that summarizes past papers along different dimensions such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.",

The performances of these approaches are affected by different factors. This paper addresses these factors and classifies them into three categories: data preparation based factors, feature representation based factors and the classification techniques based factors. The paper is a comprehensive literature-based survey that compares the performance of more than 100 DL-based SC approaches by using 21 public datasets of reviews given by customers within three specific application domains (products, movies and restaurants). These 21 datasets have different characteristics (balanced/imbalanced, size, etc.) to give a global vision for our study. The comparison explains how the proposed factors quantitatively affect the performance of the studied DL-based SC approaches.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) is a widely used contextual mining technique for extracting useful and subjective information from text-based data. It applies on Natural Language Processing (NLP), text analysis, biometrics, and computational linguistics to identify, analyse, and extract responses, states, or emotions from the data. The features analysis technique plays a significant role in the development and improvement of a SA model. Recently, GloVe and Word2vec embedding models have been widely used for feature extractions. However, they overlook sentimental and contextual information of the text and need a large corpus of text data for training and generating exact vectors. These techniques generate vectors for just those words that are included in their vocabulary and ignore Out of Vocabulary Words (OOV), which can lead to information loss. Another challenge for the classification of sentiments is that of the lack of readily available annotated data. Sometimes, there is a contradiction between the review and their label that may cause misclassification. The aim of this paper is to propose a generalized SA model that can handle noisy data, OOV words, sentimental and contextual loss of reviews data. In this research, an effective Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) based Convolution Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (CBRNN) model is proposed with for exploring the syntactic and semantic information along with the sentimental and contextual analysis of the data. Initially, the zero-shot classification is used for labelling the reviews by calculating their polarity scores. After that, a pre-trained BERT model is employed for obtaining sentence-level semantics and contextual features from that data and generate embeddings. The obtained contextual embedded vectors were then passed to the neural network, comprised of dilated convolution and Bi-LSTM. The proposed model uses dilated convolution instead of classical convolution to extract local and global contextual semantic features from the embedded data. Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used for the entire sequencing of the sentences. The CBRNN model is evaluated across four diverse domain text datasets based on accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and AUC values. Thus, CBRNN can be efficiently used for performing SA tasks on social media reviews, without any information loss.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Lexical ambiguity is present in many natural languages, but ambiguous words and phrases do not seem to be advantageous. Therefore, the presence of ambiguous words in natural language warrants explanation. We justify the existence of ambiguity from the perspective of context dependence. The main contribution of the paper is that we constructed a context learning process such that each interlocutor can infer their opponent\u2019s private belief from the conversation. A sufficient condition for successful learning is provided. Furthermore, for cases in which learning fails, we investigate how the interlocutors choose among degrees of ambiguous expressions through an adaptive learning process. Lastly, we apply our model in the lattice network, demonstrating that structural evolution favours ambiguity as well.",

This study analyzes online consumer behavior through a comparative machine learning modeling approach to forecast future customer satisfaction based on review ratings. Using a large dataset of over 100\u00a0k online orders from a major retailer, traditional machine learning models including random forest and support vector machines are benchmarked against deep learning techniques like multi-layer perceptrons. The predictive models are assessed for their ability to accurately predict customer satisfaction scores for the next orders based on key e-commerce features including delivery time, order value, and location. The findings demonstrate that the random forest model can predict future satisfaction with 92% accuracy, outperforming deep learning. The analysis further identifies core drivers of satisfaction such as delivery time and order accuracy. These insights enable retail managers to make targeted improvements, like optimizing logistics, to increase customer loyalty and revenue. This study provides a framework for leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning to unlock data-driven insights into online consumer behavior and satisfaction for superior retail decision-making. The focus on generalizable insights across a major retailer enhances the practical applicability of the machine learning approach for the retail sector.",
